# british_lottery
A short game based on the rules of British Lottery
I used Python to code this short game. 
The coding project is part of my Level 3 Gateway Software Development course at Exeter College.
The goal was to create a short lottery game, using sequencing, iteration and selection.
In this game the player decides wheter they want to play with random generated numbers or with numbers of their choice. 
The computer also generates 6 random numbers between 1 and 59: the winning numbers. Then the computer compares the two number lists and tells the player how many matches they had.
